# MVP Definition

## Product Vision
A study companion that helps self-directed learners organize learning resources,
track progress, take structured notes, and actively test their understanding
using AI-generated exercises.

The application is a helper tool, not a replacement for studying.
It does not answer assignments or exams for the user.

## Target User
Self-directed learners studying technical subjects online
(e.g. computer science, mathematics, engineering).

---

## Core Problem
Learners consume content from many sources (articles, videos, PDFs) and:
- Lose track of what they have already studied
- Struggle to organize notes across resources
- Lack structured practice to test understanding

## MVP Scope (LOCKED)

### Must-Have Features
1. Topics / Courses

   - Topics represent subjects or classes

2. Resource Tracking
   - User can add learning resources (links) to a topic
   - Resources have a status:
     - not started
     - in progress
     - completed

3. Notes
   - User can write notes for each resource
   - Notes are stored and editable
   - Notes are written manually (no AI generation)

4. AI-Generated Exercises
